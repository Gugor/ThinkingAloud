# ThinkingAloud
## Description
Thinking Aloud is a game currently in devellopment in my free time. It's a personal project I do as a hobbie. 
The game is a mixure between Space Invader and Tetrix. The mechanic is you shooting blocks that falls from the sky. The theme of the game is transforming negativity. So de idea is that the player needs to transform his/her own negative thoughts wich are represented by the falling blocks. 

Fell free to fork or colaborate in this project. :)
